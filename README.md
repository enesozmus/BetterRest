# Project 04 - BetterRest ⚙️
> - Replace each `VStack` in our form with a `Section`, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the `VStack` layout? It’s your app – you choose!
> - Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a `Picker` showing the same range of values.
> - Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
